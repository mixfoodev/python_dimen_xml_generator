This is a simple Python script that can generate multiple dimensions xml files for android projects.

**How it works**

- Edit config.py and customize the settings to your needs.
- Provide the xml source file path (eg ..\yourProject\app\src\main\res\values\dimens.xml).
- Provide the output folder (eg ..\yourProject\app\src\main\res\values\).
- Provide the smallest width of the device where you have tested the values of initial dimens.xml file.

A sample is provided in order to help you better understand how it works.
